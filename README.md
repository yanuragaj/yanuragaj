### Hi Folks ðŸ‘‹
### I'm Anurag Yadav.

# About Me
â—† As I believe in myself and always strive to learn different-different technologies/concepts â—† 

ðŸ‘‰ I still remember when I got my first personal computer and when my love for technology started. My curiosity about techs started increasing and learned multiple programming languages (Python, Dart, C++, GO). I firmly believe in sharing knowledge, and experiences and helping each other. 

ðŸ‘‰ I've got some skills in DevOps, App Development(Flutter), Web Development(Flask, JavaScript, CGI), ML/DL, and Cloud(AWS). Also good in Team building, Teamwork, Problem Solving, and Decision making. 

ðŸ‘‰ Never stop learning...
